            <h3>World Class Professional Web Dev</h3>
            <p class="top-paragraph">I design, code, and implement websites for a variety of clients. In my latest project, I redesigned a website for a privacy software company, which helped increase their sales by 25% this quarter. Through working collaboratively with marketing, design, and product teams, I have developed strong communication and teamwork skills. I can bring my technical skills and passion for collaboration to the XYZ Company team. I have always been passionate about web development, which led me to pursue a Bachelor of Computer Science degree. I am constantly seeking out new technologies and staying up-to-date on trends in the industry. XYZ Company has created some of the most innovative websites in the world, and I would be so thrilled to join the team as a Web Developer.</p>
